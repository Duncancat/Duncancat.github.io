      <p>Deploying embodied AI for autonomous science requires provable safety guarantees, yet formal verification is often dismissed 
        as computationally prohibitive for real-time robotic control. This paper empirically refutes that assumption. We introduce the 
        Verified Agentic Pipeline (VAP), an architecture that integrates physics‑informed machine learning, high‑fidelity simulation, 
        and formal verification gates to provide pre‑execution safety guarantees for embodied scientific agents. We rigorously validate 
        VAP using Hertzian contact mechanics as a representative physics domain, demonstrating that our verification approach achieves 
        a mean latency of 0.323 ms (SD=0.089 ms, 99th percentile=0.621 ms)—well within the computational budget of modern robotic control 
        loops (typically 1–10 ms). This result establishes that provable safety is not only theoretically sound but practically viable for 
        real‑time autonomous systems in scientific laboratories. By demonstrating the computational feasibility of real‑time formal verification, 
        this work opens a pathway toward trustworthy Robot Scientists capable of high‑stakes, unsupervised experimental workflows.</p>
