    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <p>I am currently a 12 grade student at the High School Affiliated to Renmin Uniersity of China. I'm interested in Engineering, Robotics, AI,
      physics, and control systems. I particularly focus on the application of physical informed machine learning and its combination with embodied AI as well 
      as human robot collaboration and the use of robotics in agriculture.</p>

      <p>I have studied online courses at Johns Hopkins University on college level math. I have also done an internship at
      <a href="https://aiexecutiveconsulting.com" target="_blank" class="body-link">AI Executive Consulting</a>, where I furthered my research.
      Two of my papers got accepted to workshops at IEEE/IROS 2025. </p>
