    <div class="section">
      <p>I am currently a 12 grade student at the High School Affiliated at Renmin Uniersity of China. I'm interested in Engineering, Robotics, AI
      physics, and control systems. I particularly foucus on the application of physical informed machine learning and its combination with embodied AI, as well 
      as human robot collaboration and the use of robotics in agricultural robotics.</p>

      <p>Previsously I studied courses at Johns Hopkins University online for colledge level math. I have also did an internship at
      <a href="https://aiexecutiveconsulting.com" target="_blank" class="sidebar-link">AI executive consulting</a>
      , where I would further my research.
      Two of my papers got accepted to workshops at IEEE/IROS 2025, which I gave two poster sessions.</p>
